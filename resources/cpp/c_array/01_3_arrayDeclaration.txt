// declare an array and initialize it with specific elements
int arr[6] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };  

// result
10, 20, 30, 40, 0, 0

// explanation
by both declaring (with size) and initializing an array, by providing specific elements, the compiler creates an array with 6 elements, which are: 10, 20, 30, 40, 0, 0
